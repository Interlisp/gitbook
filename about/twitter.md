A new favorite project: People from 1970s PARC + PARC-adjacent folks are carefully restoring/gently modernizing the Medley Interlisp system, a Lisp OS that ran on the Xerox D-machines, so that it can run on a modern VM on any OS. \

[#lisp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lisp?src=hashtag\_click) pretty cool to run [#Interlisp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Interlisp?src=hashtag\_click) Medley in a browser. Supports also Common Lisp. Thanks to [@masinter](https://twitter.com/masinter)and team! Check out the original image-based software development, dating back to BBN Lisp of the 60s, renamed Interlisp later!

> It was SUCH a productive working environment, so much better than any IDE we have today. It had two problems: it was expensive, and it was slow. But an 1108 ran at about a million instructions per second; my current Ryzen 5 runs at 86 billion. So speed isn't so much of a problem!

> Retro projects are often extremely toxic, but here they're taking care to set up a modern dev community (Zoom calls, code of conduct), enhancing docs, publishing a thorough annual report, and preserving "legacy" versions of the software too.&#x20;

> . [@interlisp8](https://twitter.com/Interlisp8?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) informs me that you - yes, you! - can still experience the Interlisp experience from the '80s. [https://t.co/JK1OgEaCMN](https://t.co/JK1OgEaCMN)\

> Interlisp came from the same milieu as Smalltalk and (I'm told) had a similar experience. People interested in recovering lost lessons, take note.

> Back in the 1980s when we used actual modern computers, [@DefnPodcast](https://twitter.com/DefnPodcast?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw), the way Interlisp handled multiple concurrent breaks in multiple threads was to pop up multiple break inspector windows on the screen, which you could deal with in whatever order.[https://t.co/AxTGFc7W8Q](https://t.co/AxTGFc7W8Q)

> Interlisp was a fascinating language that influenced the definition of Common Lisp. However, a couple of prime features have not found much traction: DWIM and structure editing. This manual hints at a lost future that's both inspiring and depressing all at once. [pic.twitter.com/NPKIBklsjk](https://t.co/NPKIBklsjk)

## Introduce yourself

###  @GitHubHandle (Your Name)
* Prior Interlisp/Medley use or  development
* What brings you here? Longer answers add to [Medley Goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q15mKHJt1fiFToamUacDWvw2UnUDJIaWLuuaeEUQS8k/edit?usp=sharing) document.

### @masinter (Larry Masinter)
* 1972-1986 (+ Common Lisp standard -89)
* See [Medley Goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q15mKHJt1fiFToamUacDWvw2UnUDJIaWLuuaeEUQS8k/edit?usp=sharing)

### @twylo (Seth Morabito)
* No prior Interlisp or Medley experience, but some very minor Symbolics Genera experience.
* I'm eager to learn more about the Medley system as a whole, and to contribute to its ongoing development, because I think that a rich diversity of past and present systems engineering is important to inform how we think about software in the future.

### @alexshendi (Alexander Shendi)
* no prior Interlisp experience (except for dabbling a bit with LISPF4)
* Was first introduced to the concept of structure editing by PC-Scheme. Interested in image based development, SEDIT and DEDIT
* Generally interested in old systems/retrocomputing

### @blakemcbride (Blake McBride)
* User of LISPF4 (an Interlisp clone) since 1980; ported LISPF4 from Fortran to C
* Deep love of the Lisp-family of languages; desire to keep Interlisp alive

### @MattHeffron (Matt Heffron)
* Recently retired and am excited to find that Interlisp is still alive.
* Used Interlisp on 1108, 1186, and HP-9000 in 1980-90's to develop Expert System products SpinPro™ and PepPro™ for Beckman Instruments, Inc.
* Author of some Lispusers packages, including POSTSCRIPT and INSPECTCODE-TEDIT.
* Attended the LOOPS training "July 11-15, 1893" (Yes, that's what the course materials say! :wink:)
* I still have all(?) of my Interlisp files, and some LISP.SYSOUT and lisp.virtualmem files  
(Would these run with current Maiko virtual machine implementation?)

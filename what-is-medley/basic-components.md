# Basic Components

An implementation of the virtual machine (like a port of the microcode that turned the Xerox hardware into a lisp machine.) The emulator, called maiko, was initially developed at Fuji Xerox for the SunOS/SPARC. It was subsequently ported to many different OS and hardware combinations.

The Lisp system itself was split into layered parts:

* The core of the system written in Lisp to implement system components including memory management, Interlisp and Common Lisp interpreters and compilers.
* Basic operating system components: thread scheduler, drivers for disk, floppy, display, keyboard; windows, menus, fonts, networking (originally PUP, then XNS, then TCP/IP).
* The Library contains additional utilities and the development environment, text editor (TEdit), debugger, source file manager, email client,etc.
* LispUsers packages were contributed by users but curated by the Interlisp developer group
* Raster image Fonts in display and print resolution
* Documentation and release notes
* Memory images (sysouts) that can be loaded run without loading or compiling anything other than compatible maiko.

### GitHub Integration

There is a GitHub Organization [Interlisp](https://github.com/interlisp) with repositories for [Maiko](https://github.com/interlisp/maiko), [Medley](https://github.com/interlisp/medley), this web site (Interlisp.github.io) and others. [Releases](https://github.com/interlisp/medley/releases), [Issues](https://github.com/interlisp/medley/issues), [Discussions](https://github.com/interlisp/medley/discussions), are all under the [Medley](https://github.com/interlisp/medley) repository.

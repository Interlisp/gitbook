# News 22 Sep 21: [InterlispOrg Inc formed](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/InterlispOrg-Inc)


# For 9 Aut 21 discussion

“Get more organization for the project”; allow us to take donations, sponsor workshops, hire some consultants for projects and issues with insufficient volunteers, buy better support from GitHub, Zoom, hire a historian or a videographer.

We talked about [starting a non-profit](https://youtu.be/q1tyOhjySNs) 2 Aug 21. Here is an [edited summary of the transcript](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/21-08-02-notes-on-organization-goals). Steve drafted some [bylaws for discussion](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/Draft-Bylaws-of-Interlisp.org).
Having a Board of Directors would structure getting advice and clarifying objectives.

We also explored other possibilities for some of those objectives. These are not exclusive. 

## [SPI Inc](https://www.spi-inc.org/projects/services/) 

* SPI takes 5% of donations for administrative overhead
* Easy to set up
* Used by many open-source projects
* initiated discussion with them

## [Software Preservation Network](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/about/)
* Membership of (mainly non-profit) organizations
* We might partner with one or more of their members
* Membership is either $5K/year or $4k/year (which offers more?)
* Hosts [Emulation as a Service infrastructure](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/emulation-as-a-service-infrastructure/), which Medley could fit into

## [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/)
* PARC gave a grant to CHM of software collection
* hosts Smalltalk Zoo
* offered to record history interview
* our ambitions for future Medley might exceed the scope of what would constitute “computer history” within their focus areas (History of AI, History of Web)
* SPN member

## Universities: Stanford, RIT, GWU, Harvard
* Prefer SPN/EaaSi members?
* Alma Mater or current affiliation of project members

## [LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar) group](https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/lfg/ilfga/constitution.html)
* Set up to allow tax-deductable donations for student travel to conferences
* LFG is a primary group keeping Medley alive

## Internet Archive
* MAME 

## [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/)
* UNESCO sponsored activity to collect and archive software
* Longer term focus claims are on reproducibility of software artifacts, however it doesn't appear that much effort has occurred in this area
